# URL-shortener built with Python and Flask

## Overview
This is a simple, yet efficient, and user-friendly URL shortener built using Python and Flask. This web application allows users to shorten their URLS, either automatically, or with a custom alias, providing a convenient way to share personal links with friends or family. The URL to this web app contains the domain "urlshortenerxa", and "pythonanywhere". The first part explains that it is a url shortener, and the "xa" are my initials! This web app is hosted online using PythonAnywhere, and can be accessed at:   http://urlshortenerxa.pythonanywhere.com/ 

## Features
  - Shorten long URLs to create compact, and easy to remember links.
  - Redirect users to the original URL when visiting the shorten link.

  - Copy link to your clipboard with one click of a button.
